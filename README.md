# ts-minesweeper

Based on https://github.com/rjz/ts-minesweeper, reorganised, modified with added support for two players.

Minesweeper clone with TypeScript, Redux, and React. Demonstrates a classic minesweeper game using tooling such as:

* Typescript
* redux
* redux-saga
* create-react-app that has not been ejected (using create-react-app-typescript).

## TODO

* Support for two players
* Use redux-saga for async logic.
* SSR

    $ yarn
    $ yarn start

...now open http://localhost:3000 to start sweeping mines!
